Economics is the study of resource allocation. What are the resources?

Micro = studies how agents make economic decisions. It derives demand functions from preference models and supply function from costs. Then, it studies properties of different types markets. 
There are 2 ways to model human preference: preference axioms, choice budgets.
Demand function is derived from utility function
cost functions represent supply
Laws of supply and demand
market is a space where supply and demand meet
market equilibrium is an optimal price which supply and demand functions intersect
There are various causes that hinders reaching market equilibrium 
Curves can shift due to various reasons
- Game Theory 


Macro = studies the behavior of the aggregate market after combining all individual supplies and demands
There is a method of combining individual supplies and demands
