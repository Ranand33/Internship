The domain of any function (modulo identifying points with the same image) is naturally bijective to the image. Genuinely elementary, but when the function preserves structure you care about this gives you all kinds of theorems (like the isomorphism theorems for groups and rings, the universal property for the quotient of a topological space, etc.) that all abstract to "to study an object, study the maps in and out of it."

  Take a deck, and remove one card without looking at it. Then turn over the other 51 cards one at a time in front of you at a steady pace. Simply observe. Don't try to count anything. When you've gone through them all, immediately take a guess at which card you never saw. Good chance you'll guess at least the number on the card, and possibly the suit
